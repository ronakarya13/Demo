- Free Bootstrap Material Design Admin\n\nMaterial Dashboard Angular is a free Material Bootstrap Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the material concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Material Dashboard was built over the popular Bootstrap framework and it comes with a couple of third-party plugins redesigned to fit in with the rest of the elements.\nMaterial Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.\nThis product came as a result of users asking for a material dashboard after we released our successful Material Kit. We developed it based on your feedback and it is a powerful bootstrap admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content managements systems and CRMs.\nMaterial Dashboard comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the card headers (blue, green, orange, red and purple) and an option to have a background image on the sidebar.\nMaterial Dashboard uses a framework built by our friend Federico - Bootstrap Material Design, who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to his team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.\nSpecial thanks go to:\nRobert McIntosh for the notification system.\nChartist for the wonderful charts.\nWe are very excited to share this dashboard with you and we look forward to hearing your feedback!\nYou can find the Github Repo here.\nTable of Contents\n\nVersions\nDemo\nQuick Start\nDocumentation\nFile Structure\nBrowser Support\nResources\nReporting Issues\nTechnical Support or Questions\nLicensing\nUseful Links\n\nVersions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML\nAngular\nVue\nReact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo\n\n\n\nDashboard\nUser Profile\nTables\nIcons\nNotifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView More.\nQuick start\nQuick start options:\n\nDownload from Github.\nDownload from Creative Tim.\n\nTerminal Commands\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.0.0 and angular 4.x.\n\nInstall NodeJs from NodeJs Official Page.\nOpen Terminal\nGo to your file project\nMake sure you have installed Angular CLI already.
